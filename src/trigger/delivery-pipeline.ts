/**
 * WorkRail Auto: Delivery Pipeline
 *
 * Defines the staged delivery pipeline executed after a successful workflow run.
 * Each stage is an independent unit of work that can fail without affecting later
 * stages (cleanup stages) or that stops the pipeline (parse stage).
 *
 * WHY staged design (not a monolithic function):
 * Future features (MR lifecycle manager, PR template support, escalating review gates)
 * are each a new DeliveryStage entry in DEFAULT_DELIVERY_PIPELINE. Adding a stage is
 * additive -- one new stage object, one new entry. Without stages, each addition grows
 * maybeRunDelivery() the same way workflow-runner.ts grew to 5000 lines.
 *
 * WHY PipelineContext (not stage return values):
 * parseHandoffStage produces a HandoffArtifact that gitDeliveryStage needs. The
 * DeliveryStage.run() interface does not chain outputs to inputs to keep the interface
 * simple. PipelineContext is a scoped mutable object created per pipeline run -- the
 * mutation is bounded and not observable outside runDeliveryPipeline().
 *
 * WHY top-level try/catch in runDeliveryPipeline:
 * maybeRunDelivery() is called inside a void queue.enqueue() callback. Any uncaught
 * exception would be an unhandled rejection that exits the Node 20 process. The
 * try/catch converts any unexpected error into a log entry, never a process crash.
