/**
 * SessionState: the explicit mutable record for a single runWorkflow() call.
 *
 * WHY a separate module: concentrates the mutation surface in one place.
 * All code that writes to SessionState fields either calls a named transition
 * function from this module or is shell-layer code (buildTurnEndSubscriber,
 * buildPreAgentSession) that documents its impurity explicitly.
 *
 * WHY named transitions: each transition function either enforces a nontrivial
 * invariant or combines related writes that must happen atomically. A bare
 * `state.currentContinueToken = token` scattered across closures is harder to
 * audit than a named `updateToken(state, token)` call.
 *
 * WHY this module has no node: or SDK imports: it is part of the functional
 * core. It must be importable in any test context without I/O stubs.
 *
 * Shell-layer code that writes state directly (buildTurnEndSubscriber increments
 * turnCount, buildPreAgentSession sets workrailSessionId) does so intentionally --
 * these are orchestration-layer mutations, not domain mutations. The SessionState
 * interface documents which fields each layer owns.
