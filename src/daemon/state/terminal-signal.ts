/**
 * TerminalSignal discriminated union and the setTerminalSignal gate.

 * constraint visible and keeps the architecture test target narrow.
 *
 * WHY first-writer-wins: invariant 1.4 (stuck takes priority over timeout)
 * is enforced structurally. The first signal set is authoritative; all
 * subsequent calls are silent no-ops. This replaces scattered
 * `if (state.stuckReason === null)` guards with a single named setter.
 *
 * WHY this module has no node: or SDK imports: it is part of the functional
 * core. It must be importable in any test context without I/O stubs.

 * write state.terminalSignal directly.
