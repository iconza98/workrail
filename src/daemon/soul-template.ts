/**
 * WorkRail Daemon Soul Template
 *
 * Exported here as a standalone zero-import module so that:
 * 1. The CLI init command can import the template without pulling in the full
 *    workflow-runner.ts dependency graph (which includes the LLM agent SDK).
 * 2. workflow-runner.ts imports from here, keeping a single source of truth.
 *
 * WHY no imports: this file must remain import-free. Any import here transitively
 * enters every CLI command that touches onboarding. Heavy deps slow CLI startup.

- Write code that follows the patterns already established in the codebase
- Never skip tests. Run existing tests before and after changes
- Prefer small, focused changes over large rewrites
- If a step asks you to write code, write actual code -- do not write pseudocode or placeholders
- Commit your work when you complete a logical unit

## File work
- File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)
- Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)
- Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)
- Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)
- Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)
- Always Read a file before Edit. Edit requires the file to have been read in this session.
- Use Edit for targeted in-place changes. Use Write only for new files or full rewrites.
- Grep output_mode: use "files_with_matches" to find which files, then Read the relevant ones.`;
