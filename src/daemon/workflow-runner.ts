/**
 * WorkRail Daemon: Autonomous Workflow Runner
 *
 * Drives a WorkRail session to completion using the first-party AgentLoop (src/daemon/agent-loop.ts).
 * Calls WorkRail's own engine directly (in-process, shared DI) rather than over HTTP.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 * - Uses agent.steer() (NOT followUp()) for step injection. steer() fires after each
 *   tool batch inside the inner loop; followUp() fires only when the agent would
 *   otherwise stop, adding an unnecessary extra LLM turn per workflow step.
 * - V2ToolContext is injected by the caller (shared with MCP server in same process).
 *   The daemon must not call createWorkRailEngine() -- engineActive guard blocks reuse.
 * - Tools THROW on failure (AgentLoop contract). runWorkflow() catches and returns
 *   a WorkflowRunResult discriminated union (errors-as-data at the outer boundary).
 * - The daemon calls executeStartWorkflow() directly before creating the Agent --
 *   this avoids one full LLM turn per session. start_workflow is NOT in the tools
 *   list; the LLM only ever calls continue_workflow for subsequent steps.
 * - continueToken + checkpointToken are persisted atomically to
 *   ~/.workrail/daemon-sessions/<sessionId>.json BEFORE the agent loop begins and
 *   BEFORE returning from each continue_workflow tool call. Each concurrent session
 *   has its own file -- they never clobber each other. Crash recovery invariant.

/**
 * Build the complete_step tool for daemon sessions.
 *
 * WHY this tool exists: continue_workflow requires the LLM to round-trip a
 * continueToken (an HMAC-signed opaque token). The LLM frequently mangles
 * this token, causing TOKEN_BAD_SIGNATURE errors that kill sessions. complete_step
 * eliminates this failure mode by having the daemon inject the continueToken
 * internally -- the LLM only provides notes, artifacts, and context.
 *
 * WHY two token-update paths: the continueToken must be updated on both
 * (a) successful advance: getCurrentToken() returns the new next-step token
 *     from the response, which onAdvance will have stored before the next call.
 * (b) blocked retry: the engine returns a retryContinueToken that must be used
 *     on the retry call; onTokenUpdate updates the closure variable so the next
 *     complete_step call injects the correct retry token.
 * Both paths are mutually exclusive (kind: 'ok' vs kind: 'blocked') and cannot
 * race because AgentLoop runs tools sequentially (toolExecution: 'sequential').
 *
 * WHY getCurrentToken is a getter (not a value): the closure variable
 * currentContinueToken in runWorkflow() is updated after each step advance.
 * The getter captures the variable by reference so each complete_step call
 * reads the current token at call time, not at construction time.
 *
 * @param sessionId - Process-local UUID for crash-recovery token persistence.
 * @param ctx - V2ToolContext from the shared DI container.
 * @param getCurrentToken - Getter that returns the current continueToken from the
 *   runWorkflow() closure. Called at tool execution time, not construction time.
 * @param onAdvance - Called after a successful step advance with the next step text
 *   and the new continueToken. Sets pendingSteerText and updates currentContinueToken.
 * @param onComplete - Called when the workflow is complete.
 * @param onTokenUpdate - Called when the continueToken changes without an advance
 *   (i.e., on a blocked retry). Updates currentContinueToken in the runWorkflow() closure.
 * @param schemas - Plain JSON Schema map from getSchemas().
 * @param _executeContinueWorkflowFn - Optional injection point for testing.
 * @param emitter - Optional event emitter for structured lifecycle events.
 * @param workrailSessionId - WorkRail session ID for event correlation.

/**
 * Build the spawn_agent tool for daemon sessions.
 *
 * Spawns a child WorkRail session in-process, blocking the parent until the child completes.
 * Returns `{ childSessionId, outcome, notes }` as a JSON string so the parent LLM can reason
 * about the child's result and decide how to proceed.
 *
 * WHY in-process (not via TriggerRouter.dispatch): dispatch() uses a global Semaphore and is
 * fire-and-forget. Calling it from inside a running session would deadlock (parent holds a slot
 * waiting for child to acquire one). Direct runWorkflow() call is naturally blocking via await.
 *
 * WHY pre-create session (Candidate 2): calls executeStartWorkflow() first so childSessionId is
 * deterministic and the child is observable in the session store from the moment execute() is called.
 * Crash-before-start is observable (zombie session with parentSessionId). Adapts the proven
 * _preAllocatedStartResponse pattern from console-routes.ts.
 *
 * WHY errors as data (not throw): a child failure should not abort the parent session. The parent
 * LLM receives { outcome: 'error', notes: errorMessage } and decides how to proceed. This is
 * different from other tools (complete_step, Bash) which throw on failure because those failures
 * ARE errors in the parent session's own execution.
 *
 * WHY currentDepth is a constructor parameter (not read from store): depth is set at factory
 * construction time by runWorkflow(), which reads trigger.spawnDepth. For checkpoint-resumed
 * sessions, the daemon restarts the AgentLoop from scratch and re-reads trigger.spawnDepth --
 * the constructor parameter is always correct. Store reads would add async I/O and error paths
 * for a theoretical edge case that does not exist in practice.
 *
 * @param sessionId - Process-local UUID (for logging correlation).
 * @param ctx - V2ToolContext from the shared DI container.
 * @param apiKey - Anthropic API key for the child session's Claude model.
 * @param thisWorkrailSessionId - WorkRail session ID of the parent (becomes parentSessionId in child).
 * @param currentDepth - Spawn depth of the parent session (0 for root sessions).
 * @param maxDepth - Maximum allowed spawn depth. Blocks spawn when currentDepth >= maxDepth.
 * @param runWorkflowFn - Injected runWorkflow function (allows testing without real LLM calls).
 * @param schemas - Plain JSON Schema map from getSchemas().
 * @param emitter - Optional event emitter for structured lifecycle events.

 */
const BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `\
You are WorkRail Auto, an autonomous agent that executes workflows step by step. You are running unattended -- there is no user watching. Your entire job is to faithfully complete the current workflow.

## What you are
You are highly capable. You handle ambitious, multi-step tasks that require real codebase understanding. You don't hedge, ask for permission, or stop to check in. You work.

## Your oracle (consult in this order when uncertain)
1. The daemon soul rules (## Agent Rules and Philosophy below)
2. AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md in the workspace (injected below under Workspace Context)
3. The current workflow step's prompt and guidance
4. Local code patterns in the relevant module (grep the directory, not the whole repo)
5. Industry best practices -- only when nothing above applies

## Self-directed reasoning
Ask yourself questions to clarify your approach, then answer them yourself using tools before acting. Never wait for a human to answer -- you are the oracle.

Bad pattern: "I'll analyze both layers." (no justification)
Good pattern: "Question: Should I check the middleware? Answer: The workflow step says 'trace the full call chain', and the AGENTS.md says the entry point is in the middleware layer. Yes, start there."

## Your tools
- \`complete_step\`: Mark the current step complete and advance to the next one. Call this after completing ALL work required by the step. Include your notes (min 50 characters) in the notes field. The daemon manages the session token internally -- you do NOT need a continueToken. This is the preferred advancement tool for daemon sessions.
- \`continue_workflow\`: [DEPRECATED -- use complete_step instead. Do NOT pass a continueToken.] Only use this if complete_step is unavailable.
- \`Bash\`: Run shell commands. Use for building, testing, running scripts.
- \`Read\`: Read files.
- \`Write\`: Write files.
- \`report_issue\`: Record a structured issue, error, or unexpected behavior. Call this AND complete_step (unless fatal). Does not stop the session -- it creates a record for the auto-fix coordinator.
- \`spawn_agent\`: Delegate a sub-task to a child WorkRail session. BLOCKS until the child completes. Returns \`{ childSessionId, outcome: "success"|"error"|"timeout", notes: string }\`. Always check \`outcome\` before using \`notes\`. IMPORTANT: your session's time limit (maxSessionMinutes) keeps running while the child executes -- ensure your parent session has enough time for both your work AND the child's work. Maximum spawn depth is 3 by default (configurable). Use only when a step explicitly asks for delegation or when a clearly separable sub-task would benefit from its own WorkRail audit trail.
- \`signal_coordinator\`: Emit a structured mid-session signal to the coordinator WITHOUT advancing the workflow step. Use when the step asks you to surface a finding, request data, request approval, or report a blocking condition. Always returns immediately -- fire-and-observe. Signal kinds: "progress", "finding", "data_needed", "approval_needed", "blocked".

## Execution contract
1. Read the step carefully. Do ALL the work the step asks for.
2. Call \`complete_step\` with your notes. No continueToken needed -- the daemon manages it.
3. Repeat until the workflow reports it is complete.
4. Do NOT skip steps. Do NOT call \`complete_step\` without completing the step's work.

## The workflow is the contract
Every step must be fully completed before you call complete_step. The workflow step prompt is the specification of what 'done' means -- not a suggestion. Don't advance until the work is actually done.

Your cognitive mode changes per step: some steps make you a researcher, others a reviewer, others an implementer. Adopt the mode the step describes. Don't bring your own agenda.

## Silent failure is the worst outcome
If something goes wrong: call report_issue, then continue unless severity is 'fatal'. Do NOT silently retry forever, work around failures without noting them, or pretend things worked. The issue record is how the system learns and self-heals.

## Tools are your hands, not your voice
Don't narrate what you're about to do. Use the tool and report what you found. Token efficiency matters -- you have a wall-clock timeout.

## You don't have a user. You have a workflow and a soul.
If you're unsure, consult the oracle above. If nothing answers the question, make a reasoned decision, call report_issue with kind='self_correction' to document it, and continue.

## IMPORTANT: Never use continue_workflow in daemon sessions
complete_step is your advancement tool. It does not require a continueToken. Do NOT call continue_workflow with a token you found in a previous message -- use complete_step instead.\
