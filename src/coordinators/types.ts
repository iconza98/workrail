/**
 * Coordinator Context and Session Chaining Types
 *
 * Typed result for child session execution in coordinator pipelines.
 *
 * WHY a separate file (not inline in pr-review.ts):
 * ChildSessionResult is consumed by coordinator logic, coordinator-deps.ts
 * (implementation), and future coordinator scripts. Keeping it in types.ts
 * avoids circular imports between the interface file and implementation.
 *
 * Design invariants:
 * - ChildSessionResult is a discriminated union -- all switch statements must be exhaustive.
 * - The in-process coordinator (coordinator-deps.ts) reads the session store directly via
 *   ctx.v2.sessionStore; there is no nullable infrastructure that can produce a degraded
 *   await. The await_degraded variant has been removed.
 *
 * WHY delivery_failed is NOT a reason variant here:
 * Sessions spawned via spawnSession/spawnAndAwait construct a WorkflowTrigger with no
 * callbackUrl. WorkflowDeliveryFailed is produced by TriggerRouter only when a callbackUrl
 * POST fails -- a code path that is unreachable for coordinator-spawned sessions.
 * spawn_agent uses ChildWorkflowRunResult (which also excludes delivery_failed) for the
 * same reason. The type says exactly what can happen; delivery_failed cannot happen here.

/**
 * Typed context passed to spawned sessions by coordinators.
 *
 * WHY explicit fields (not Readonly<Record<string,unknown>> or index signature):
 * Every field a coordinator can pass must be declared here. Unknown fields are
 * rejected by TypeScript, preventing coordinators from silently injecting data
 * that agents can't access via typed extraction. Adding a new field requires
 * a deliberate type change, not an ad-hoc string key.
 *
 * Invariant: assembledContextSummary is only set when the rendered string is
 * non-empty. Callers guard with `if (rendered.trim().length > 0)` before
 * constructing -- the illegal state (set but empty) cannot arise.

/**
 * Typed result of a child session execution.
 *
 * WHY discriminated union (not boolean flags):
 * A plain { success: boolean; timedOut: boolean } allows illegal states like
 * success:true && timedOut:true. The discriminated union makes these
 * unrepresentable at compile time and forces exhaustive handling at every switch.
 *
 * Variants:
 * - success: child session ran to completion
 * - failed: child session reached a terminal failure state (blocked or stuck)
 * - timed_out: coordinator gave up waiting; child may still be running
 *
 * WHY await_degraded is absent: the in-process coordinator reads the session store
 * directly via ctx.v2.sessionStore, which is always available when the daemon is
 * running. There is no nullable infrastructure that could produce a degraded await.
