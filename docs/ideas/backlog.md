# Ideas Backlog

Workflow and feature ideas that are worth capturing but not yet planned or designed.

## Workflow ideas

### Standup Status Generator

- **Status**: idea
- **Summary**: A workflow that automatically generates a daily standup status by aggregating activity across the user's tools since the last standup.
- **Data sources** (adaptive based on what the user has available):
  - Git history (commits, branches, PRs/MRs)
  - GitLab (merge requests, comments, reviews)
  - Jira (ticket transitions, comments, new assignments)
  - Other issue trackers or project management tools the user configures
- **Key behavior**:
  - Detect the last standup date (stored in session or inferred from history)
  - Aggregate activity since that date across all configured sources
  - Categorize into "what I did", "what I'm doing today", and "blockers"
  - Generate a concise, human-readable standup message
- **Design considerations**:
  - Should be tool-agnostic: detect available integrations and adapt
  - Could leverage MCP tool discovery to find available data sources at runtime
  - Needs a lightweight persistence mechanism for last-standup timestamp
  - Output format should be configurable (Slack message, plain text, structured JSON)

## Feature ideas

### Dashboard artifacts (replace file-based docs)

- **Status**: designed, not yet implemented
- **Summary**: Instead of having agents write markdown files into the working repo, agents would submit structured artifacts through `continue_workflow` output payloads. Artifacts are stored per-session and rendered in the console/dashboard. Eliminates repo pollution and gives users a single place to see all workflow outputs.
- **Key dependencies**: console/dashboard UI (does not exist yet), server-side artifact storage
- **Design doc**: `docs/reference/workflow-execution-contract.md` (section "Replacing File-Based Docs with Dashboard Artifacts")

### Derived / overlay workflows for bundled workflow specialization

- **Status**: parked idea
- **Note**: see `docs/roadmap/open-work-inventory.md` for details

### Workflow categories and category-first discovery

- **Status**: idea
- **Summary**: Improve workflow discovery by organizing bundled workflows into categories and teaching `list_workflows` to support a category-first exploration path instead of always returning one large flat list.
- **Why this seems useful**:
  - the workflow catalog is getting large enough that flat discovery is becoming noisy
  - agents often do not know the exact workflow ID they want, but they may know the task family (coding, review, docs, investigation, planning, learning)
  - category-first discovery could reduce prompt overload and make workflow selection feel more guided
- **Possible phase 1 shape**:
  - add workflow categories as metadata on workflow definitions or a registry-side mapping
  - extend `list_workflows` with an optional category-style input
  - if no category is passed, return:
    - category names
    - workflow count per category
    - a few representative workflow titles per category
    - guidance telling the agent to call `list_workflows` again with the category it wants
  - if a category is passed, return the full workflows for that category with names, descriptions, IDs, and hashes
- **Possible phase 2 shape**:
  - support multiple discovery views such as grouped-by-category, grouped-by-source, or full flat list
  - add filtering by category + source + maybe keywords
  - align category discovery with future platform / multi-root discovery work
- **Design questions**:
  - should categories live in workflow JSON, in a registry overlay, or be inferred from directory / naming conventions?
  - should `list_workflows` become polymorphic, or should category discovery be a separate read-only tool / mode?
  - how much summary content should the uncategorized response include before it becomes too verbose again?
  - how do categories interact with routines, examples, project workflows, and external workflow repositories?
- **Risks / tradeoffs**:
  - changing `list_workflows` is a real tool contract and output-schema change, not just a UI tweak
  - overloading one tool with too many discovery modes could make the contract less predictable
  - static categories can drift unless there is a clear ownership model
- **Related docs / context**:
  - `docs/plans/workrail-platform-vision.md` (already discusses grouped discovery by source)
  - `docs/roadmap/open-work-inventory.md` (legacy workflow modernization increases the need for better discovery)
  - current implementation: `src/mcp/handlers/v2-workflow.ts`, `src/mcp/v2/tools.ts`, `src/mcp/output-schemas.ts`

### Multi-root workflow discovery and setup UX

- **Status**: designing
- **Summary**: Simplify third-party and team workflow hookup by requiring explicit `workspacePath`, silently remembering repo roots in user-level `~/.workrail/config.json`, recursively discovering team/module `.workrail/workflows/` folders under remembered roots, and improving grouped source visibility / precedence explanations. Use workspace-aware ranking, cross-repo surfacing, and later console integration as the control plane for inspecting remembered roots, discovered workflow sources, and precedence. For remote repositories, prefer **managed sync by default** so users experience remote workflow repos as connected and kept current while WorkRail still reasons over a local effective state. Avoid trusting MCP roots and avoid requiring workflow config to live at the main repo root.
- **Current recommendation**:
  - phase 1: `Rooted Team Sharing + minimal Source Control Tower`
  - require explicit workspace identity
  - silently persist repo roots at the user level
  - support cross-repo workflows from remembered roots
  - make remote repos default to managed-sync mode rather than pinned snapshots or live-remote behavior
  - treat Slack/chat/file/zip sharing as an ingestion path that classifies into repo, file, pack, or snippet flows
  - design the backend so the console can eventually manage and explain the remembered/discovered source model
- **Additional idea**:
  - explore enterprise auth / SSO integration for private repo access, such as Okta-backed flows for GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, or other self-hosted providers
  - likely shape: WorkRail detects that a private repo uses org-managed auth and guides the user through the right browser/device-code/credential flow instead of assuming raw personal-access-token setup
  - main question: should WorkRail integrate directly with identity providers like Okta, or should it integrate one layer lower with Git hosts / credential helpers that are already SSO-aware?
- **Design doc**: `docs/ideas/third-party-workflow-setup-design-thinking.md`

### Workflow rewind / re-scope support

- **Status**: idea
- **Summary**: Allow an in-progress workflow session to go back to an earlier point when new information changes scope understanding, invalidates assumptions, or reveals that the current execution path is wrong.
- **Why this seems useful**:
  - agents and users often learn important scope information only after work has already started
  - current step-by-step enforcement is strong, but it can feel rigid if the original framing turns out to be wrong
  - a first-class rewind / re-scope mechanism could make workflows feel safer and more adaptable without abandoning structure
- **Possible phase 1 shape**:
  - allow rewind to a prior checkpoint or earlier decision node with an explicit reason
  - record a short “why we rewound” note in session history
  - make the resumed path visible in the console/session timeline
- **Possible phase 2 shape**:
  - support scope-change prompts like:
    - “our understanding changed”
    - “the task is broader/narrower than we thought”
    - “we need to revisit planning before implementation”
  - let workflows declare safe rewind points or re-scope checkpoints explicitly
  - support branch-aware comparison between abandoned and current paths
- **Design questions**:
  - should rewind be limited to explicit checkpoints, or should WorkRail support arbitrary node-level rewind?
  - how should the system preserve durable notes and outputs from abandoned paths?
  - should some workflow steps be marked as non-rewindable once external side effects have happened?
  - how should the agent explain to the user what changed and why a rewind is appropriate?
- **Risks / tradeoffs**:
  - rewind power could make workflows feel less deterministic if used too casually
  - durable session history gets more complex when abandoned paths and resumed paths coexist
  - workflows with real-world side effects may need stricter rollback / compensation rules

### Console engine-trace visibility and phase UX

- **Status**: idea
- **Summary**: Evolve the console from a node-only DAG viewer into an execution-aware surface that shows both created nodes and the engine decisions that explain how the run got there. This should make fast paths, skipped phases, condition evaluation, loop entry/exit, and branch selection legible instead of looking like missing DAG nodes or broken rendering.
- **Why this seems useful**:
  - users currently see only `node_created` / `edge_created`, which makes legitimate engine behavior look like missing workflow phases
  - workflows use authoring concepts like phases, fast paths, run conditions, and loop gates, but the console does not show those decisions today
  - sessions like small-task fast paths can appear to “jump” from phase 0 to phase 5 even when the engine is behaving correctly
- **Current gap**:
  - engine event log records `decision_trace_appended`, `context_set`, and related runtime decisions
  - console DTOs expose only run status plus DAG nodes/edges and node detail
  - there is no first-class UI for “why the engine chose this path”
- **Recommended direction**:
  - keep phases as authoring / workflow-organization concepts
  - stop treating the rendered DAG as the whole execution story
  - add an engine-trace / decision layer that can show:
    - selected next step
    - evaluated conditions
    - entered/exited loops
    - important run context variables such as `taskComplexity`
    - skipped / bypassed planning paths such as small-task fast paths
- **Possible phase 1 shape**:
  - extend console service / DTOs with a run-scoped execution-trace summary
  - show a compact “engine decisions” strip or timeline above the DAG
  - annotate jumps such as “small-task fast path selected” so sparse DAGs do not look broken
- **Possible phase 2 shape**:
  - richer explainability timeline with branches, skipped authoring phases, and condition results
  - allow toggling between “execution DAG” and “engine trace” views, or combine them in one unified run narrative
  - surface effective run context and selected branch/loop decisions in node detail or run detail
- **Design questions**:
  - should the console continue using phase-oriented labels in the primary UI, or should it prefer step titles / execution narrative labels?
  - should trace events appear as first-class timeline items, DAG annotations, or a separate run-explanation panel?
  - what subset of run context variables is useful enough to surface without becoming noisy?
  - how do we distinguish authoring structure from runtime execution structure cleanly in the UX?
- **Risks / tradeoffs**:
  - exposing too much raw engine state could make the console noisier and harder to scan
  - mixing authoring structure and runtime trace without clear separation could create more confusion, not less
  - DTO growth needs care so the console does not become tightly coupled to every low-level event detail
- **Related docs / context**:
  - `docs/reference/workflow-execution-contract.md`
  - `docs/design/v2-core-design-locks.md`
  - `docs/plans/workrail-platform-vision.md`
  - current implementation: `src/v2/usecases/console-service.ts`, `src/v2/projections/run-context.ts`, `console/src/api/types.ts`

### Workflow previewer for compiled and runtime behavior

- **Status**: idea
- **Summary**: Add a workflow previewer for the `workflows/` directory that shows what a workflow actually compiles to and how the engine can traverse it at runtime.
- **Why this seems useful**:
  - authors currently have to mentally reconstruct branching, loops, blocked-node behavior, and other runtime structure from authored JSON plus tests
  - advanced workflow authoring gets much easier when the compiled DAG and runtime edges are visible
  - it would help explain engine behavior to both contributors and workflow authors
- **What it should show**:
  - the compiled step graph / DAG
  - branch points and condition-driven paths
  - loop structure and loop-control edges
  - blocked / resumed / checkpoint-related node shapes where applicable
  - template/routine expansion boundaries or provenance
  - the gap between authored JSON structure and runtime execution structure
- **Initial scope**:
  - start as a read-only preview for bundled workflows
  - optimize for accuracy over polish
  - do not require full execution simulation in phase 1
- **Design questions**:
  - should this live in the existing Console, as a dev-only page, or as a local authoring utility?
  - should it show only the compiled DAG, or also annotate likely runtime transitions such as blocked attempts, rewinds, and loop continuations?
  - how much provenance should it expose for injected routines/templates?
