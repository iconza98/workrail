## P0 / Critical (blocks WorkTrain from working correctly)

### Agent is doing coordinator work

**Status: bug** | Priority: P0

The agent ran `cd /path/to/main-checkout && git log`, `gh issue view`, read roadmap docs, checked open PRs -- coordinator work. The agent should never do this. It is a worker: receive scoped task, produce output, call `complete_step`. All environment setup, context gathering, git operations, worktree management, PR creation, and orchestration is coordinator responsibility.

The coordinator should: create the worktree before the agent starts, pass a clean context packet (issue body, relevant code, what to produce), handle all git operations after the agent finishes, spawn specialized sub-agents for subtasks.

**Near-term mitigation:** Inject `sessionWorkspacePath` (the worktree) into the system prompt instead of `trigger.workspacePath` (main checkout), and explicitly tell the agent "do not run git commands, do not read roadmap docs -- that is coordinator work." Partial fix held pending full redesign.

**Full fix:** Coordinator-heavy pipeline redesign (see below).

---

### Wrong directory: agent worked in main checkout instead of worktree

**Status: bug** | Priority: P0

All bash commands used `cd /main-checkout` instead of the worktree. Code changes went nowhere. Delivery found nothing to commit and silently skipped. Root cause: system prompt names `trigger.workspacePath`, not `sessionWorkspacePath`.

---

### Agent faked commit SHAs in handoff block

**Status: bug** | Priority: high

Handoff block `agentCommitShas` contained existing main-branch SHAs from `git log`, not new commits. Fix: coordinator records commit SHAs itself (before/after diff) rather than trusting the agent.

---

### `taskComplexity=Small` misclassification

**Status: bug** | Priority: medium

Issue #241 (TTL eviction across multiple files + new tests) was classified as Small, skipping design review, planning audit, and verification loops. Consider requiring human confirmation on Small classification before bypassing phases.

---

### Daemon binary stale after rebuild, no indication to user

**Status: ux gap** | Priority: medium

After `npm run build`, `worktrain daemon --start` launches the old binary. No warning. Fix: compare binary mtime to running process's binary and warn if stale.

---

### `worktrain daemon --start` reports success even when daemon crashes immediately

**Status: bug** | Priority: medium

Health check waits 1 second then checks `launchctl list`. If daemon crashes in < 1s, check sees a PID and reports success. Fix: poll for up to 5 seconds, verify daemon is still running at end of window.

---

### Handoff block not surfaced to operator

**Status: ux gap** | Priority: medium

Agent writes a complete handoff block (commitType, prTitle, prBody, filesChanged) to the session store. Invisible to operator without digging through event logs. Fix: `worktrain status <sessionId>` should show it; console session detail should surface it prominently.

---

## WorkTrain Daemon

The autonomous workflow runner (`worktrain daemon`). Completely separate from the MCP server -- calls the engine directly in-process.


### `wr.refactoring` workflow (Apr 28, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

A dedicated `wr.refactoring` workflow for structural refactors that don't change behavior. Distinct from `wr.coding-task` because refactors have a different shape: no new features, no bug fixes, just architecture alignment. The workflow should enforce:
- **Discovery phase**: understand current state, identify violations, classify scope
- **Test-first phase**: write tests for any extracted pure functions BEFORE extracting them (TDD red)
- **Extraction phase**: one slice at a time, tests green after each
- **Verification phase**: full suite green, build clean, no behavior changes
- **Doc update phase**: update any reference docs that describe the changed invariants

The `wr.coding-task` workflow has too much overhead for pure refactors (design review, risk assessment gating, PR strategy) and not enough refactor-specific discipline (test-first enforcement, behavior-unchanged verification).

---

### API key baked into launchd plist at install time (Apr 24, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

`worktrain daemon --install` captures `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the current shell environment and bakes it into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.worktrain.daemon.plist` (mode 600). The key persists in the plist file indefinitely and is visible to anyone who can read the file or takes a backup of `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

**Better approach:** Read `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from `~/.workrail/.env` at daemon startup rather than baking it into the plist. The plist would only contain the non-secret env vars (AWS_PROFILE, WORKRAIL_TRIGGERS_ENABLED, PATH). Secrets live in `~/.workrail/.env` which is already the designated secrets file and is already loaded by `loadDaemonEnv()` at startup.

**Implementation:** In `captureEnvVars()` in `src/cli/commands/worktrain-daemon.ts`, exclude `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (and any other `*_API_KEY` vars) from the captured set. The daemon already calls `loadDaemonEnv()` which reads `~/.workrail/.env` -- operators just need to put the key there instead of in their shell env.

**Migration:** Existing installs have the key in the plist. `worktrain daemon --install` should detect an existing plist with an API key and print a migration note.

---

### runWorkflow() functional core refactor -- Phase 2 (Apr 24, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped in PR #830 (Apr 29, 2026)

Phase 1 landed in PR #818: extracted `tagToStatsOutcome`, `buildAgentClient`, `evaluateStuckSignals`, `SessionState`, and `finalizeSession`. Phase 2 landed in PR #830:

**What remains:**

**Extract `buildSessionConfig(trigger, loadedCtx) -> SessionConfig`** -- a pure function that takes already-loaded context (soul content, workspace context string, session notes array -- all loaded by I/O before the call) and returns everything the agent loop needs: system prompt, tool list, session limits, model/client config. Currently this logic is scattered through the setup phase alongside the I/O calls that load the data.

```typescript
interface SessionContext {
  readonly systemPrompt: string;
  readonly tools: readonly AgentTool[];
  readonly sessionTimeoutMs: number;
  readonly maxTurns: number;
  readonly initialPrompt: string;
  readonly agentCallbacks: AgentLoopCallbacks;
}

function buildSessionContext(
  trigger: WorkflowTrigger,
  agentClient: AgentClientInterface,
  modelId: string,
  soulContent: string,           // already loaded by loadDaemonSoul()
  workspaceContext: string | null, // already loaded by loadWorkspaceContext()
  sessionNotes: readonly string[], // already loaded by loadSessionNotes()
  state: SessionState,
  // ... tool factories, schemas, etc.
): SessionContext
```

The shell then does:
1. All I/O in sequence: `loadDaemonSoul`, `loadWorkspaceContext`, `loadSessionNotes`, `git worktree add`, `executeStartWorkflow`, `parseContinueTokenOrFail`, `persistTokens`
**What Phase 2 delivered (PR #830):**
- `PreAgentSession` interface + `PreAgentSessionResult` discriminated union -- all early-exit paths type-enforced
- `buildPreAgentSession()` -- all pre-agent I/O extracted; steer+daemon registries registered after all failing I/O (FM1 invariant)
- `constructTools()` -- explicitly impure named function, `state` as explicit parameter
- `persistTokens()` returns `Promise<Result<void, PersistTokensError>>` using `src/runtime/result.ts`
- `sidecardLifecycleFor()` pure function with `assertNever` exhaustiveness
- TDZ hazard fixed: `abortRegistry.set()` now registered after `const agent = new AgentLoop()`

**Phase 3 (PRs #835, #837)** continued the refactor:
- `buildTurnEndSubscriber()` extracted -- runWorkflow() body: 539 → 426 lines
- Tool param validation at LLM boundary (8 tool factories)
- `buildAgentCallbacks()` + `buildSessionResult()` pure functions -- body: 426 → 308 lines
- Test flakiness fix: `settleFireAndForget()` + `retry: 2` in vitest config

**Still deferred:**
- `CriticalEffect<T>` / `ObservabilityEffect` type distinction
- `StateRef` mutation wrapper
- Zod tool param validation (replacing manual typeof checks -- requires zodToJsonSchema or two sources of truth)
- `wr.refactoring` workflow (see backlog entry above)

## Shared / Engine

The durable session store, v2 engine, and workflow authoring features shared by all three systems.


### Improve commit SHA gathering consistency in wr.coding-task

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

After fixing the primary cause (SHA footer referenced `continue_workflow` by name while daemon agents use `complete_step`), two structural gaps remain that prevent consistent SHA recording:

**Gap 1: SHA footer appears on every non-final step, including planning/design steps with no commits.** Agents correctly skip it on those steps, but the repetition trains them to suppress it reflexively -- including on implementation steps where it matters. Options to explore: inject only inside loop bodies tagged as implementation, add an opt-out flag to steps, or move the SHA reminder into the implementation step prompts directly in the workflow JSON.

**Gap 2: `phase-5-small-task-fast-path` has no correctly-wired final metrics step for Small tasks.** `isLastStep` resolves to `phase-7b-fix-and-summarize`, which has a `runCondition` that skips it for Small tasks. Small-task sessions never see the final metrics footer. Needs either: the final footer added directly to `phase-5`'s authored prompt, or `isLastStep` detection made context-aware (complex).

**Gap 3: No validation for `metrics_commit_shas`.** `checkContextBudget` validates `metrics_outcome` but not SHAs. Missing or partial arrays fail silently. A warning-level soft validation at the final step would at least surface the gap in logs.

The right fix is probably a combination of moving the SHA instruction into the implementation step prompts directly (removing it from the ambient footer entirely) and adding Gap 2's final footer to `phase-5`. That avoids any new engine machinery.

---

### `jumpIf`: conditional step jumps with per-target jump counter

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Problem:** Workflows with investigation or iterative refinement patterns (bug-investigation, mr-review) can exhaust their hypothesis set and reach an `inconclusive_but_narrowed` state with no structural way to restart an earlier phase. A `jumpIf` primitive would let any step conditionally restart execution from an earlier step when a context condition is met.

**Proposed design:**

```json
{
  "id": "phase-4b-loop-decision",
  "jumpIf": {
    "condition": { "var": "diagnosisType", "equals": "inconclusive_but_narrowed" },
    "target": "phase-2-hypothesis-generation-and-shortlist",
    "maxJumps": 2
  }
}
```

**Engine behavior:**
- When a step completes and its `jumpIf.condition` is met, the engine checks the per-session jump counter for `target`
- Counter is derived from the event log: count `jump_recorded` events where `toStepId === target` -- fully append-only and replayable
- If `counter < maxJumps`: append `jump_recorded` event, create fresh nodeIds for `target` and all subsequent steps, mint a new continueToken pointing at the fresh target node
- If `counter >= maxJumps`: jump is blocked, execution falls through to the next step (safety cap, not an error)

**Why this is safe:**
- `maxJumps` is a required field -- no unbounded loops possible
- Counter is derivable from the append-only event log -- no mutable state
- Fall-through on limit reached is predictable and operator-visible

**Open design questions:**
- `maxJumps` default if omitted -- probably require it explicitly (same as `maxIterations` on loops)
- DAG console rendering -- backward jumps create "re-entry" edges. Needs a distinct visual treatment
- Interaction with `runCondition` -- if a jumped-to step has a `runCondition` that evaluates false at re-entry time, does the engine skip it and advance?

**Scope when ready to implement:**
- `spec/workflow.schema.json`: add `jumpIf` to `standardStep`
- `spec/authoring-spec.json`: add authoring rule
- Compiler: validate `target` resolves to a reachable earlier step, `maxJumps >= 1`
- Engine (`src/v2/durable-core/`): new `jump_recorded` event kind, counter derivation, fresh nodeId creation on jump
- Console DAG: render jump edges distinctly

**Motivation workflow:** `wr.bug-investigation` -- when all hypotheses are eliminated and `diagnosisType === 'inconclusive_but_narrowed'`, jump back to phase 2 (hypothesis generation) with the eliminated theories in context, up to 2 times before falling through to validation/handoff.

---

### Versioned workflow schema validation

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium-high

**Problem:** WorkRail validates workflow files against the schema bundled in the currently-running MCP binary. Binary too new rejects old workflows; binary too old rejects new workflows. Both cause silent disappearance from `list_workflows` with no explanation.

**The right fix:** Each workflow declares `"schemaVersion": 1` (integer). The binary ships validator copies for every schema version it supports. When loading a workflow, pick the validator matching the declared version.

**Load-time logic:**
1. Read `schemaVersion` (default 1 if absent -- legacy workflows)
2. If `schemaVersion === current`: validate against current schema directly
3. If `schemaVersion < current` (binary newer): validate against the declared schema version
4. If `schemaVersion > current` (binary too old): load leniently with warnings -- `additionalProperties: false` does not apply

**Decision (from Apr 23 audit):** v1 = current schema. The one historical breaking change (`assessmentConsequenceTrigger`, Apr 5) was fully contained within the bundled workflow corpus. No historical reconstruction needed.

**Files to change:** `spec/workflow.schema.json`, `spec/workflow.schema.v1.json` (snapshot), `src/application/validation.ts`, `src/types/workflow-definition.ts`, `workflow-for-workflows.json` (stamp `schemaVersion`), all bundled workflows.

---

### Task re-dispatch loop protection

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Problem:** When a pipeline session fails (stuck, crash, timeout), the idempotency sidecar expires after its TTL and the queue re-selects the same issue on the next poll cycle. There is no memory of how many times an issue has been attempted. A task that consistently fails gets retried indefinitely, burning API credits with no forward progress.

**Concrete incident:** Issue #393 was dispatched in a loop -- discovery + shaping + coding sessions repeatedly started, failed stuck, and were re-dispatched.

**Design:** Extend `queue-issue-<N>.json` to include `attemptCount`. On each new dispatch for the same issue, increment. When `attemptCount >= maxAttempts` (default 3), skip dispatch, emit outbox notification, apply a `worktrain:needs-human` label, and post a comment on the issue.

**Human reset:** Closing/reopening the issue, removing the `worktrain:stuck` label, or `worktrain retry <issueNumber>`.

**Files:** `src/trigger/adapters/github-queue-poller.ts`, `src/trigger/polling-scheduler.ts`, daemon sidecar schema.

---

### Daemon agent loop stall detection

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Problem:** A daemon session that stops making LLM API calls (hung tool, network issue with no timeout, silent deadlock) spins until the wall-clock timeout fires -- up to 55-65 minutes. No indication to the operator, no early abort, no event emitted.

**Design:** In `src/daemon/agent-loop.ts`, add a per-turn heartbeat timer that resets each time an LLM call starts. If the timer fires (120s with no new turn), call `agent.abort()` and emit `agent_stuck` with `reason: 'no_llm_turn'`. Configurable via `agentConfig.stallTimeoutSeconds`.

**Where to look:** `src/daemon/agent-loop.ts` `_runLoop()`, `src/daemon/workflow-runner.ts` stuck detection, `src/daemon/daemon-events.ts` `AgentStuckEvent`.

---

### `queue-poll.jsonl` never rotated

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Bug:** `~/.workrail/queue-poll.jsonl` grows indefinitely -- `appendFile`-only, no rotation. At 5-minute poll intervals: ~8-87 MB/month depending on activity. Disk exhaustion risk on long-running daemons.

**Fix:** Add a size check before appending in `appendQueuePollLog()`. If file exceeds 10 MB, rotate: rename to `queue-poll.jsonl.1`, start fresh. Keep at most 2 rotated files.

**File:** `src/trigger/polling-scheduler.ts`, `appendQueuePollLog()`.

---

### ReviewSeverity: stderr bypassing injected dep

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Bug 1 (DONE):** `assertNever` on `ReviewSeverity` was added at `pr-review.ts:1407`. ✓

**Bug 2 (still open):** `src/coordinators/pr-review.ts:447` -- `process.stderr.write(...)` called directly instead of using injected `deps.stderr`. Tests that inject a fake dep miss this log.

**File:** `src/coordinators/pr-review.ts`.

---

### Session continuation / "just keep talking"

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

A completed session is not dead -- the conversation is still in the event log. The only thing blocking continuation is the engine rejecting messages to sessions in `complete` state.

**The change:** Remove that gate. `worktrain session continue <sessionId> "<message>"` sends a message to a completed session. New events appended to the same log. Same session ID. The agent has full context of everything it ever did.

Context window overflow (very long sessions) is a separate optimization problem -- truncate oldest turns while keeping step notes. Don't solve it now.

---

### Session as a living record: post-completion phases

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

A `session_completed` event means the original workflow is done -- not that the session can never receive new events. The event log is append-only: just keep appending. A post-completion interaction adds a `session_resumed` event, then new turns, then a new `session_completed`.

This is already how mid-run resume works. The same mechanism extends naturally to post-completion: rehydrate the completed state, append a new lightweight phase, run it, complete again.

**Richer automatic checkpoints:** Many session events should trigger a checkpoint automatically:
- `step_advanced` (already essentially a checkpoint)
- `signal_coordinator` fired (agent surfaced meaningful mid-step state)
- Worktree commit pushed (code state durable on remote)
- Coordinator steers the session (notable injection)
- `spawn_agent` child completes (parent has new information)

---

### Rules preprocessing: normalize workspace rules before injection

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Problem:** WorkTrain injects all rules files raw into every agent's system prompt. A workspace with `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.windsurf/rules/*.md`, and `AGENTS.md` might inject 10KB of rules into a discovery session that only needs 2KB.

**Design:** A `worktrain rules build` command that reads all IDE rules files from the workspace, deduplicates overlapping rules, categorizes by phase, and writes to `.worktrain/rules/`:
- `implementation.md`, `review.md`, `delivery.md`, `discovery.md`, `all.md`
- `manifest.json` -- which files exist, when generated, source files used

At session time: WorkTrain injects only the phase-relevant file.

---

### True session status (live agent state in console)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium-high

**Problem:** The console currently infers session status from last event timestamp. WorkTrain has direct access to `DaemonRegistry`, `DaemonEventEmitter`, and turn-level events -- it should show true status.

**True session status taxonomy:**
- `active:thinking` -- LLM API call in progress
- `active:tool` -- tool executing (name visible)
- `active:idle` -- between turns, session in DaemonRegistry
- `stuck` -- stuck heuristic fired
- `completed:success/timeout/stuck/max_turns`
- `aborted` -- daemon killed mid-run
- `daemon:down` -- no recent heartbeat

Surface in: `worktrain status`, `worktrain health <sessionId>`, console session rows.

---

## WorkTrain Daemon -- Coordinator patterns

Coordinator design patterns for WorkTrain's autonomous pipeline.


### Event-driven agent coordination (coordinator as event bus)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Problem:** Agents managing an MR should not poll for review comments or CI status -- that wastes turns and burns tokens. Instead, the coordinator should register for events and steer the agent when something relevant happens.

The infrastructure already exists: `steerRegistry` + `POST /sessions/:id/steer`, `signal_coordinator` tool, `DaemonEventEmitter`.

**What's missing:** Coordinator-side event sources (GitHub webhooks or polling fallback) and an event-to-steer bridge that maps `MREvent` to structured steer messages.

**How it works:** MR management agent session is parked (no pending turns). Coordinator registers for GitHub events. When review comment/CI failure/approval arrives, coordinator steers the running session. Agent responds. No polling from the agent side.

**Agent session prompt:** "Do not poll for PR status. Wait for the coordinator to deliver events via injected messages."

---

### MR lifecycle manager

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Gap:** WorkTrain currently creates a PR and dispatches an MR review session. Everything between "PR created" and "PR merged" is invisible: CI failures, reviewer comments, requested changes, merge conflicts, required approvals. A human has to watch and intervene.

**Vision:** `runMRLifecycleManager()` takes ownership of the MR from creation to merge.

**Responsibilities:**
1. MR creation with correct template, labels, milestone, reviewers, linked tickets
2. CI pipeline monitoring -- parse failures, retry flaky tests, spawn fix sessions
3. Review comment triage -- classify each comment (actionable/question/nit/approval/blocker), reply autonomously or escalate
4. Approval tracking -- when all gates pass, trigger merge
5. Merge conflict resolution -- rebase or escalate complex conflicts
6. Merge execution + downstream ticket/notification updates

**Dependency:** PR template support, phase-scoped rules, `dispatchCondition` webhook filter.

---

### Phase-scoped context files

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Design:** Teams define context files scoped to specific pipeline phases under `.worktrain/rules/`:
- `discovery.md`, `shaping.md`, `implementation.md`, `review.md`, `delivery.md`, `pr-management.md`, `all.md`

Each file is injected only into sessions running the matching pipeline phase. Reduces token waste and rule dilution. `all.md` is equivalent to today's AGENTS.md injection.

**Load order (most specific wins):** `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (base) → `.worktrain/rules/all.md` → phase-specific file.

---

### Coordinator architecture: separation of concerns

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Problem:** `src/coordinators/pr-review.ts` is already ~500 LOC doing session dispatch, result aggregation, finding classification, merge routing, message queue drain, and outbox writes. Adding knowledge graph queries, context bundle assembly, and prior session lookups would create a god class.

**Right layering:**
```
Trigger layer         src/trigger/          receives events, validates, enqueues
Dispatch layer        (TBD)                 decides which workflow + what goal
Context assembly      (TBD)                 gathers and packages context before spawning
Orchestration layer   src/coordinators/     spawns, awaits, routes, retries, escalates
Delivery layer        src/trigger/delivery  posts results back to origin systems
```

**Context assembly** is the missing layer. Before dispatching a coding session, `assembleContext(task, workspace)` runs: knowledge graph query, upstream pitch/PRD fetch, relevant prior session notes, returns a structured context bundle. The orchestration script should call this, not own it.

---

### Scheduled tasks (native cron provider)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Gap:** No native cron/schedule provider. Workaround is OS crontab calling `curl`.

**Design:**
```yaml
triggers:
  - id: weekly-code-health
    provider: schedule
    cron: "0 9 * * 1"
    workflowId: architecture-scalability-audit
    workspacePath: /path/to/repo
    goal: "Run weekly code health scan"
```

**Key decisions:**
- Standard 5-field cron syntax, configurable timezone
- Missed runs NOT caught up by default (optional `catchUp: true`)
- Overlap prevention: if a run is still active when the next tick fires, skip it
- `worktrain run schedule <trigger-id>` for manual trigger

**Implementation:** `PollingScheduler` already runs time-based loops. Schedule provider would use cron expression matching instead of API polling. State persists to `~/.workrail/schedule-state.json`.

---

### Autonomous grooming loop + workOnAll mode

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Three autonomy levels:**

- **Level 0 (current):** Human applies `worktrain` label to specific issues. WorkTrain works those only.
- **Level 1 -- workOnAll:** Config flag `workOnAll: true`. WorkTrain looks at ALL open issues, infers which are actionable, picks highest-priority. Escape hatch: `worktrain:skip` label.
- **Level 2 -- Fully proactive:** WorkTrain also surfaces work it found itself (failing CI, backlog items with no issue, patterns in git history).

**Grooming loop (scheduled nightly):** Reads backlog, open issues, recent completed work. Closes resolved issues. For ungroomed items: infers maturity (linked spec, acceptance criteria, vague language). For high-value idea-level items: runs `wr.discovery` + `wr.shaping`, creates/updates issue.

**workOnAll config:**
```json
{ "workOnAll": true, "workOnAllExclusions": ["needs-design", "blocked-external"], "maxConcurrentSelf": 2 }
```

---

### Escalating review gates based on finding severity

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Problem:** "Blocking" is binary -- a single Critical finding and a trivially incorrect comment are treated identically.

**Right behavior:** After a fix round, if re-review still returns Critical:
1. Another full MR review -- confirm the Critical is real, not a false positive
2. Production readiness audit -- a Critical finding often implies a runtime risk
3. Architecture audit -- if the Critical is architectural

Routing by `finding.category` from `wr.review_verdict`:
- `correctness` / `security` -> always trigger prod audit
- `architecture` / `design` -> trigger arch audit
- All -> trigger re-review

**Hard rule:** A PR that triggered the escalating audit chain should NEVER auto-merge. Human explicit approval required.

---

### Workflow execution time tracking and prediction

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Problem:** Timeouts are set by intuition. No data on how long workflows actually take.

**What to track:** For every completed session -- workflow ID, total wall-clock duration, turn count, step advances, outcome, task complexity signals. Store in `~/.workrail/data/execution-stats.jsonl`.

**Uses:**
- Calibrate timeouts automatically (p95 * 1.5)
- Predict duration before dispatch
- Step-advance rate as workflow efficiency proxy

**Implementation:** Append to `execution-stats.jsonl` in `runWorkflow()`'s finally block.

---

### WorkRail MCP server self-cleanup

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Sources of stale state:** old workflow copies in `~/.workrail/workflows/`, dead managed sources, stale git repo caches, 500+ sessions accumulating with no TTL, remembered roots for non-existent paths.

**Fix -- two layers:**

1. **Startup auto-cleanup (light):** On MCP server startup, silently remove managed sources where the filesystem path doesn't exist. Log "removed N stale sources."

2. **`workrail cleanup` command:**
   ```
   workrail cleanup [--yes] [--sessions --older-than <age>] [--sources] [--cache] [--roots]
   ```

---

### Subagent context packaging

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Problem:** When a main agent spawns a subagent, the work package is too thin. The main agent has rich context (why this approach was chosen, what was tried, what constraints were discovered) but packages the subagent task as a one-liner.

**Design (Option B -- structured work package):**
```typescript
spawnSession({
  workflowId: 'coding-task-workflow-agentic',
  goal: '...',
  context: {
    whyThisApproach: '...',
    alreadyTried: [...],
    knownConstraints: [...],
    relevantFiles: [...],
    completionCriteria: '...'
  }
})
```

**Context mode:** `context: 'inherit' | 'blank' | 'custom'`. Blank is for adversarial roles (challenger, reviewer) where anchoring to main-agent context is counterproductive.

**Session knowledge log:** As the main agent progresses, it appends to `session-knowledge.jsonl` -- decisions, user pushback, relevant files, constraints, things tried and failed. Auto-included in subagent work packages.

---

### Workflow-scoped system prompts for subagents

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Design:** Workflows (and individual steps) can declare a `systemPrompt` field injected into subagent sessions.

```json
{
  "id": "mr-review-workflow.agentic.v2",
  "systemPrompt": "You are an adversarial code reviewer. Your job is to find problems, not validate the approach.",
  "steps": [...]
}
```

Step-level `systemPrompt` overrides workflow-level for that step.

**Composition layers:**
1. WorkTrain base prompt
2. Workflow-level `systemPrompt`
3. Step-level `systemPrompt`
4. Soul file (operator behavioral rules)
5. AGENTS.md / workspace context
6. Session knowledge log (if `context: 'inherit'`)
7. Step prompt

---

### `context-gather` step type

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Problem:** Phase 0.5 in the coding workflow currently looks for a shaped pitch by checking a local path. This doesn't handle coordinator-injected context, manually written docs (GDoc, Confluence, Notion), Glean-indexed artifacts, or URLs embedded in the task description. The search logic is duplicated if other workflows need the same document.

**Proposed primitive:**
```json
{
  "type": "context-gather",
  "id": "gather-pitch",
  "contextType": "shaped-pitch",
  "outputVar": "shapedInput",
  "optional": true,
  "sources": ["coordinator-injected", "local-paths", "task-url", "glean"]
}
```

**Source resolution order (stops at first hit):**
1. `coordinator-injected` -- coordinator already attached context of this type
2. `local-paths` -- check `.workrail/current-pitch.md`, `pitch.md`, `.workrail/pitches/`
3. `task-url` -- extract any URL from task description and fetch
4. `glean` -- search Glean for recent docs matching task keywords (opt-in only)

**Why engine-level:** Coordinator intercept requires the engine to check "has this type already been provided?" before running any search. A routine can't express that.

## WorkRail MCP Server

The stdio/HTTP MCP server that Claude Code (and other MCP clients) connect to. MUST be bulletproof -- crashes kill all in-flight Claude Code sessions.



## Console

### Console interactivity and liveliness

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Key areas:**
- **DAG node hover effects** -- nodes in `RunLineageDag` should have visible hover states: border brightens, subtle glow, cursor changes to pointer. This is the single highest-impact item.
- **Node selection highlight** -- selected node should pulse or glow, not just change border color
- **Live session pulse** -- sessions with `status: in_progress` could have a subtle periodic animation
- **Tooltip polish** -- fade in/out rather than appearing instantly

**Design constraint:** Dark navy, amber accent aesthetic. Additions should reinforce this language.

**Where to start:** `console/src/components/RunLineageDag.tsx`. The tooltip pattern (`handleNodeMouseEnter`/`handleNodeMouseLeave`) already exists; a hover glow is a natural peer addition.

**Related:** `docs/design/console-cyberpunk-ui-discovery.md`, `docs/design/console-ui-backlog.md`

### Console engine-trace visibility and phase UX

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Gap:** Users currently see only `node_created`/`edge_created`, which makes legitimate engine behavior look like missing workflow phases. Fast paths, skipped phases, condition evaluation, and loop gates are invisible.

**Recommended direction:**
- Keep phases as authoring/workflow-organization concepts
- Add an engine-trace/decision layer showing: selected next step, evaluated conditions, entered/exited loops, important run context variables (e.g. `taskComplexity`), skipped/bypassed planning paths

**Phase 1:** Extend console service/DTOs with a run-scoped execution-trace summary. Show a compact "engine decisions" strip or timeline above the DAG.

**Phase 2:** Richer explainability timeline with branches, skipped phases, condition results. Toggle between "execution DAG" and "engine trace" views.

---

### Console ghost nodes (Layer 3b)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

Ghost nodes represent steps that were compiled into the DAG but skipped at runtime due to `runCondition`. Currently the DAG just shows fewer nodes with no indication of what was bypassed. Layer 3b would render skipped nodes as faded/ghost elements with a tooltip explaining the skip condition.

## Workflow Library

### General-purpose workflow / intelligent dispatcher

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

Two related ideas:

**`wr.quick-task`** -- the simplest possible workflow. 2 steps: do the work, call complete_step. No complexity routing, no design review, no phased implementation. For tasks under ~10 minutes. Currently small tasks go through `wr.coding-task`'s Small fast-path which is still heavier than needed.

**`wr.dispatch`** -- an intelligent routing workflow. Given a goal, classify it and route to the right workflow: `wr.quick-task` | `wr.research` | `wr.coding-task` | `wr.mr-review` | `wr.competitive-analysis`. The general-purpose entry point -- not a workflow that does everything, but one that decides which workflow to use. The adaptive pipeline coordinator already does this for the queue-poll trigger; the question is whether to expose it as a named user-facing workflow.

Open questions: does `wr.dispatch` replace `workflowId` in trigger config, or coexist alongside it? How does it handle tasks that don't fit any known workflow?

---

### MR review session count inflation

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

A single PR review dispatches 6-12 autonomous sessions (one per reviewer family: correctness_invariants, runtime_production_risk, missed_issue_hunter, etc.). This inflates session counts, complicates cost attribution, and makes ROI calculations imprecise. Worth investigating: are all 6 families catching distinct issues, or is there significant overlap? Should families be parallelized into a single session with sub-agents rather than separate top-level sessions?

---

### Session trigger source attribution (daemon vs MCP)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

No reliable way to determine whether a session was started by the daemon (WorkTrain) or a human via MCP (Claude Code). Every session-level metric and ROI calculation is ambiguous without this.

**Fix:** Add `triggerSource: 'daemon' | 'mcp'` to `run_started` event data. One-line change at each entry point, makes attribution permanent and queryable from the event log.

Files: `src/v2/durable-core/schemas/session/events.ts`, `src/mcp/handlers/v2-execution/start-workflow.ts`, `src/daemon/workflow-runner.ts`.

---

### Standup status generator

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

A workflow that aggregates activity across git history, GitLab/GitHub MRs and reviews, and Jira ticket transitions since the last standup. Outputs a categorized ("what I did / doing today / blockers") human-readable message. Tool-agnostic: detect available integrations and adapt.

---

### Workflow effectiveness assessment and self-improvement proposals

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Idea:** WorkTrain runs workflows hundreds of times. It should use that data to propose improvements.

**Per-run metrics to collect:**
- Steps skipped most often (candidate for removal)
- Steps consuming the most tokens/time
- Steps where the agent calls `continue_workflow` immediately (prompt too vague or redundant)
- Sessions that produced PRs with Critical findings (workflow not thorough enough)
- Sessions that completed vs hit max_turns

**Output:** Structured proposal per workflow:
- Step-level issues with evidence (specific sessions, specific steps)
- Proposed changes with confidence and impact estimate
- Feed directly into `workflow-for-workflows`

**Flow-back:** Low-confidence proposals as GitHub issues. High-confidence, low-risk proposals auto-applied to local copy + PR to community.

---

## Platform Vision (longer-term)

### Knowledge graph for agent context

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Problem:** Every session starts with a full repo sweep. Context gathering subagents re-read the same files, re-trace the same call chains, re-identify the same invariants.

**Design -- two-layer hybrid:**

**Layer 1: Structural graph (hard edges, deterministic)**
Built by `ts-morph` (TypeScript Compiler API) + DuckDB. Captures: `imports`, `calls`, `exports`, `implements`, `extends`, `registers_in`, `tested_by`. Answers precise questions with certainty: "what imports trigger-router.ts?", "what CLI commands are registered?"

**Layer 2: Vector similarity (soft weights, semantic)**
Every node gets an embedding. Answers fuzzy questions: "what is conceptually related to this?", "what past sessions are relevant to this bug?" Built with LanceDB (embedded, TypeScript-native, local-first).

**Technology:**
- Structural: `ts-morph` + DuckDB
- Vector: LanceDB + local embedding model (Ollama or `@xenova/transformers`)
- Unified query: `query_knowledge_graph(intent)` returns merged structural + semantic results

**Build order:** Structural layer spike first (1-day). Vector layer after spike proves the foundation. Incremental update: re-index only files in `filesChanged` after each session.

**Build decision (from Apr 15 research):** ts-morph + DuckDB wins. Cognee: Python-only. GraphRAG/LightRAG: use LLMs to build graph (violates scripts-over-agent). Mem0/Zep: conversational memory, not code graphs. Sourcegraph: enterprise weight, overkill.

---

### Dynamic pipeline composition

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Insight:** Not all tasks are equal in how much work is needed before implementation. A raw idea needs a completely different pipeline than a fully-specced ticket.

**Maturity spectrum:**
- `idea` -> `rough` -> `specced` -> `ready` -> `code-complete`

**Coordinator reads maturity + existing artifacts and prepends the right phases:**
- Nothing -> ideation -> market research -> spec authoring -> ticket creation -> implementation
- BRD + designs -> architecture review -> implementation
- Fully specced -> coding only

**New workflows needed:**
- `classify-task-workflow` -- fast, 1-step, outputs `taskComplexity`/`riskLevel`/`hasUI`/`touchesArchitecture`/`taskMaturity`
- `ideation-workflow`, `spec-authoring-workflow`, `ticket-creation-workflow`, `grooming-workflow`

---

### Per-workspace work queue

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**The insight:** Triggers make WorkTrain reactive. A work queue makes it proactive -- it pulls the next item when capacity is available, works it to completion, pulls the next.

**Internal queue:** `~/.workrail/workspaces/<name>/queue.jsonl` -- append-only, one item per line, consumed in priority order then FIFO.

**External pull sources:**
- GitHub issues (label filter)
- GitLab issues (label filter)
- Jira sprint board
- Linear triage queue

**Queue + message queue + talk:**

| Interface | Use case | Latency |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Work queue | "do this when you have capacity" | When a slot is free |
| Message queue (`worktrain tell`) | "do this now, between current sessions" | End of current batch |
| Talk (`worktrain talk`) | "let's discuss and decide together" | Interactive |

---

### Remote references (URLs, GDocs, Confluence)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Design:** Extend the workflow `references` system to support remote sources (HTTP URLs, Google Docs, Confluence pages). WorkRail remains a pointer system -- it validates declarations are well-formed, delivers the pointer, and the agent fetches with its own tools. Auth is entirely delegated to the agent.

**Incremental path:**
- Phase 1: public HTTP URLs. `resolveFrom: "url"`. WorkRail delivers the URL; agent fetches. No auth surface in WorkRail.
- Phase 2: workspace-configured bearer tokens in `.workrail/config.json` keyed by domain
- Phase 3: named integrations (GDocs, Confluence, Notion) as first-class configured sources

**Design questions:**
- Should WorkRail attempt a reachability check at start time, or skip entirely for remote refs?
- How should remote refs appear in `workflowHash`? Content can change between runs.
- `kind` field (`local` vs `remote`) or infer from `source` value?

---

### Declarative composition engine

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Summary:** Users or agents fill out a declarative spec (dimensions, scope, rigor level) and the WorkRail engine assembles a workflow automatically from a library of pre-validated routines. The agent is a form-filler, not an architect -- the composition logic lives in the engine.

**Why different from agent-generated workflows:** Engine-composed workflows are assembled from pre-reviewed building blocks using deterministic rules. Same spec always produces the same workflow shape.

**Good early use cases:** Audit-style workflows (user picks dimensions, engine assembles auditor steps), review workflows, investigation workflows.

---

### Workflow categories and category-first discovery

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Summary:** Improve workflow discovery by organizing bundled workflows into categories. Currently the catalog is large enough that flat discovery is becoming noisy.

**Phase 1 shape:** If no category is passed, return category names + workflow count per category + a few representative titles. If a category is passed, return the full workflows for that category.

**Design questions:**
- Should categories live in workflow JSON, in a registry overlay, or be inferred from directory/naming?
- Should `list_workflows` become polymorphic, or should category discovery be a separate mode?

---

### Forever backward compatibility (workrailVersion)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

Every workflow declares `workrailVersion: "1.4.0"`. The engine maintains compatibility adapters for all previous declared versions -- old workflows run forever without author intervention. The engine adapts; authors never migrate.

**The web model:** this is how browsers handle HTML from 1995. A `<marquee>` tag still renders because the browser adapts, not because the author rewrote their page.

**Engineering implication:** permanent commitment. Once a version adapter is shipped, it cannot be removed. The tradeoff is real but the alternative (expecting external authors to track WorkRail releases and migrate) breaks the platform trust model.

**Phase 1:** Add `workrailVersion` field to schema. Default to `"1.0.0"` for existing workflows. Record in run events.
**Phase 2:** Introduce the first adapter when the first schema-breaking change is needed.
**Phase 3:** Build a compatibility test harness in CI.

**Related:** `src/v2/read-only/v1-to-v2-shim.ts` (existing precedent for version adaptation).

---

### Parallel forEach execution

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

Sequential `forEach` (and `for`, `while`, `until`) all work -- implemented in the v1 interpreter and the v2 durable core. The idea here is parallel execution: run all iterations concurrently rather than sequentially. Requires design around: session store concurrent writes, token protocol isolation per iteration, and console DAG rendering for parallel branches.

---

### Assessment-gate tiers beyond v1

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Tier 1 (current):** Same-step follow-up retry. Consequence keeps the same step pending; engine returns semantic follow-up guidance.

**Tier 2 (future):** Structured redo recipe on the same step. Engine surfaces a bounded checklist. No new DAG nodes or true subflow.

**Tier 3 (future):** Assessment-triggered redo subflow. Matched consequence routes into an explicit sequence of follow-up steps. Introduces assessment-driven control-flow behavior.

**Design questions:** When does Tier 2 become necessary? What durable model would Tier 3 need for entering, progressing through, and returning from a redo subflow?

---

### Workflow rewind / re-scope support

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

Allow an in-progress session to go back to an earlier point when new information changes scope, invalidates assumptions, or reveals the current path is wrong.

**Phase 1:** Allow rewind to a prior checkpoint with an explicit reason. Record a "why we rewound" note in session history.

**Phase 2:** Scope-change prompts ("our understanding changed", "the task is broader/narrower"). Let workflows declare safe rewind points explicitly.

**Design questions:**
- Should rewind be limited to explicit checkpoints, or support arbitrary node-level rewind?
- How should the system preserve notes from abandoned paths?
- Should some steps be marked non-rewindable once external side effects have happened?

---

### Subagent composition chains

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

Native support for nested subagents -- an agent spawning a subagent, which spawns its own -- up to a configurable depth limit.

```yaml
agentDefaults:
  maxSubagentDepth: 3
  maxTotalAgentsPerTask: 10
```

**Depth semantics:** Coordinator=0, worker=1, subagent=2, sub-subagent=3.

`maxTotalAgentsPerTask` prevents exponential explosion: depth-3 tree with 3 agents per node = 27 concurrent agents without this cap.

---

### Mobile monitoring and remote access

**Status: idea** | Priority: low (post-daemon-MVP)

**Goal:** Control and monitor autonomous WorkRail sessions from a phone.

**What's needed:**
1. Mobile-responsive console with touch-friendly layout and tap to pause/resume/cancel
2. Push notifications (via Slack/Telegram webhook -- no native app required for MVP)
3. Human-in-the-loop approval on mobile -- maps to `POST /api/v2/sessions/:id/resume`
4. Session log view -- linear timeline, not DAG

**Remote access options:**
1. `workrail tunnel` command (Cloudflare Tunnel from the laptop) -- works behind any NAT/VPN
2. Tailscale integration -- zero WorkRail code needed
3. Cloud session sync -- daemon pushes events to S3/R2

**Priority:** Post-daemon-MVP. Design the REST control plane with mobile in mind from the start.

---

### WorkRail Auto: cloud-hosted autonomous platform

**Status: idea** | Priority: long-term

**Goal:** WorkRail Auto runs on a server 24/7, connected to your engineering ecosystem, working autonomously without a laptop open.

**What this enables:** GitLab MR opened -> WorkRail reviews, posts comment. Jira ticket moves to In Progress -> WorkRail starts coding task, pushes branch. PagerDuty fires -> WorkRail runs investigation, posts findings to Slack.

**Architecture implications:**
- Multi-tenancy: isolated session stores, isolated credential vaults per org
- Horizontal scaling: multiple daemon instances consuming from a shared trigger queue
- Rate limiting per org, per integration

**Relationship to self-hosted:** Self-hosted is always free, always open source, always works offline. WorkRail Auto is the natural SaaS layer -- same engine, same workflows, managed infrastructure.

**Priority:** Long-term. Design the local daemon with multi-tenancy seams in mind from the start (don't hardcode single-user assumptions). Don't build the hosted layer until the local daemon is proven.

---

### Multi-project WorkTrain

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium (to investigate)

**Problem:** WorkTrain needs to handle multiple completely unrelated projects simultaneously, but some projects are related and need to share knowledge.

**Proposed model:** Workspace namespacing with explicit cross-workspace links:
```yaml
workspaces:
  workrail:
    path: ~/git/personal/workrail
    knowledgeGraph: ~/.workrail/graphs/workrail.db
    maxConcurrentSessions: 3
    relatedWorkspaces: [storyforge]
  storyforge:
    path: ~/git/personal/storyforge
    knowledgeGraph: ~/.workrail/graphs/storyforge.db
    relatedWorkspaces: [workrail]
```

**Must be workspace-scoped:** knowledge graph, daemon-soul.md, session store, concurrency limits, triggers.

**Can be shared globally:** WorkTrain binary, token usage tracking, message queue, merge audit log.

---

### Message queue: async communication with WorkTrain from anywhere

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Design:** A persistent message queue (`~/.workrail/message-queue.jsonl`) that decouples when you send a message from when WorkTrain acts on it.

```bash
worktrain tell "skip the architecture review for the polling triggers PR, it's low risk"
worktrain tell "add knowledge graph vector layer to next sprint"
```

Each command appends to the queue. The daemon drains between agent completions -- never mid-run, always at a natural break point.

**Outbox (WorkTrain -> user):** WorkTrain appends notifications to `~/.workrail/outbox.jsonl`. A mobile client polls this or an HTTP SSE endpoint wraps it.

**This is the foundation for mobile monitoring.** The mobile app is just a client that reads outbox and writes to message-queue.

---

### Periodic analysis agents

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

Agents on a schedule that proactively identify issues, gaps, improvement opportunities:

- **Weekly: Code health scan** -- `architecture-scalability-audit` on modules not audited in 30 days
- **Weekly: Test coverage scan** -- files modified with zero/low test coverage
- **Weekly: Documentation drift scan** -- recently merged PRs changed behavior described in docs
- **Monthly: Dependency health scan** -- CVEs, active forks, lighter alternatives
- **Monthly: Performance baseline** -- benchmark scenarios vs previous month
- **Continuous: Security scan** -- on every PR merge, OWASP top 10 patterns in changed files
- **Monthly: Ideas generation** -- `wr.discovery` on codebase + backlog + session history, asking "what's the most impactful thing we could build next?"

---

### Monitoring, analytics, and autonomous remediation

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

WorkTrain watches application health metrics (error rate, latency, session success/failure rate, queue depth), identifies anomalies, investigates root causes, and resolves what it can automatically.

**Monitoring loop:** Detect anomaly -> classify severity -> investigate with `bug-investigation.agentic.v2` -> if confidence >= 0.8 and severity <= High, attempt auto-remediation (config/feature-flag fix, code fix) or else escalate with full findings.

**Analytics dashboard:** Per-module PR cycle time, workflow step failure rates, token cost per session type, quality score (weighted composite of review accuracy + coding success rate + investigation accuracy).

---

### Cross-repo execution model

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium (post-MVP for hosted tier)

**Problem:** WorkRail currently assumes a single repo. The autonomous daemon breaks this -- a coding task may touch Android, iOS, and a backend API simultaneously.

**Workspace manifest:** Sessions declare which repos they need:
```json
{
  "context": {
    "repos": [
      { "name": "android", "path": "~/git/my-project/android" },
      { "name": "backend", "path": "~/git/my-project/backend" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Scoped tools:** `BashInRepo`, `ReadRepo`, `WriteRepo` that route to the correct working directory.

**Dynamic provisioning:** If the repo is already cloned locally, use it. If declared as a remote URL, clone to `~/.workrail/repos/<name>/`.

**This is the feature that makes WorkRail truly freestanding** for multi-repo development teams.

---

### Long-term vision: WorkRail as a general engine, domain packs as configuration

**Status: idea** | Priority: long-term

WorkTrain is not just a coding tool. The underlying engine -- session management, workflow enforcement, daemon, agent loop, knowledge graph, context bundle assembly -- is domain-agnostic.

**Domain packs:** Self-contained configuration bundles that specialize WorkTrain for a specific problem domain: a set of workflows, a knowledge graph schema, context bundle query definitions, trigger definitions, a daemon soul template.

**Examples:** `worktrain-coding` (current default), `worktrain-research`, `worktrain-creative`, `worktrain-ops`, `worktrain-data`.

**When to make it explicit:** The right time is when a second domain is ready to be added. Extract the coding-specific pieces into `worktrain-coding` and establish the domain pack contract.

---

## Done / Shipped

### Autonomous background agent platform (WorkTrain daemon)

**Status: done** | Shipped as `worktrain daemon`

WorkTrain is a persistent background daemon that initiates workflows autonomously, integrates with external systems, and uses the console as a control plane. Key shipped capabilities:
- `runWorkflow()` with `KeyedAsyncQueue` for concurrent session serialization
- `spawn_agent` / multi-agent subagent delegation
- Polling triggers (GitLab MRs, GitHub issues/PRs, GitHub queue poll)
- Webhook triggers via generic provider
- Worktree isolation (`branchStrategy: worktree`)
- Bot identity (`botIdentity`) and acting-as-user support
- Dynamic model selection (`agentConfig.model`)
- macOS notifications
- SteerRegistry + mid-session injection
- AbortRegistry + SIGTERM graceful shutdown
- `maxOutputTokens` per trigger, `maxQueueDepth` with HTTP 429
- Crash recovery Phase B
- `daemon-soul.md` / workspace context injection
- `complete_step` tool
- Execution stats + structured event log
- Stuck detection (`repeated_tool_call`, `no_progress`)
- `signal_coordinator` tool
- `worktrain init` soul setup
- Per-trigger crash safety (`persistTokens`)
- Worktree orphan cleanup on delivery failure
- runWorkflow() Phase 2 architecture (PR #830): `PreAgentSession`/`buildPreAgentSession`, `constructTools`, `persistTokens` Result type, `sidecardLifecycleFor` pure function, TDZ hazard fix for abort registry
- runWorkflow() Phase 3 architecture (PRs #835, #837): `buildTurnEndSubscriber` (539→426 lines), tool param validation at LLM boundary (8 factories), `buildAgentCallbacks` + `buildSessionResult` pure functions (426→308 lines), test flakiness fix (settleFireAndForget + retry:2)

### WorkRail engine / MCP features

**Status: done**

- Assessment gates v1 with consequences
- Loop control -- all four types (`while`, `until`, `for`, `forEach`) implemented
- Fix: sequential `artifact_contract` while loops -- stale stop artifacts from earlier loops no longer contaminate later loops (PR #830). Root cause: `collectArtifactsForEvaluation()` passed full session history to `interpreter.next()`; fix passes only `inputArtifacts` (current step's submitted artifacts).
- Subagent guidance feature
- References system (local file refs)
- Routine/templateCall injection
- Workspace source discovery
- Branch safety (never checkout main into worktree) -- enforced via trigger validation rules and worktree isolation in daemon; NOT a compiled `wr.features.*` engine feature
- Console execution trace Layers 1+2+3a
- Console MVI architecture
- `worktrain` CLI (logs, health, status, trigger validate)
- Notification service

### Scripts-over-agent design principle

**Status: done** -- codified in AGENTS.md and daemon-soul.md

The agent is expensive, inconsistent, and slow. Scripts are free, deterministic, and instant. Any operation the daemon can perform with a shell script, git command, or API call should be done that way -- not delegated to the LLM.

### Dynamic model selection

**Status: done** -- shipped in `triggers.yml` `agentConfig.model`

### Multi-agent support (spawn_agent + coordinator sessions)

**Status: done (partial)** -- `spawn_agent` tool and coordinator sessions with `steer` are shipped. Full `spawn_session`/`await_sessions` as first-class workflow primitives is still an idea (see "Native multi-agent orchestration" above).

### WorkTrain onboarding (`worktrain init`)

**Status: done (basic version)** -- initial soul setup ships. The full guided LLM-provider + trigger + smoke-test onboarding flow described in the idea above is not yet built.

### Daemon context customization

**Status: done** -- `~/.workrail/daemon-soul.md`, AGENTS.md auto-inject, direct `start_workflow` call from daemon.

### Workflow complexity routing

**Status: done (partial)** -- `runCondition`/QUICK/STANDARD/THOROUGH rigor modes ship. A dedicated classify-task-workflow and the full dynamic pipeline coordinator are still ideas above.

### `wr.*` namespace rename

**Status: done** -- all bundled workflows renamed to `wr.*` namespace (PR #782).

### Metrics outcome validation

**Status: done** -- `checkContextBudget` validates `metrics_outcome` enum (PR f0a1822a). SHA validation (Gap 3 above) is still open.

### wr.coding-task architecture enforcement + retrospective (v1.3.0)

**Status: done** -- shipped in PR #830 (Apr 29, 2026)

- Phase 0 architecture alignment check: agent scans candidate files and names philosophy violations explicitly by function name; captures `architectureViolations` and `architectureStartsFromScratch`
- Phase 1c conditional fragment: when `architectureStartsFromScratch = true`, blocks adapting existing violations as valid design candidates
- Phase 8 post-implementation retrospective: runs for all tasks (no complexity gate); four practical questions applicable to any task; requires 2-4 concrete observations with explicit disposition
