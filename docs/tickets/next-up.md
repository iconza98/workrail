# Next Up

Groomed near-term tickets. Check `docs/roadmap/now-next-later.md` first for the current priority ordering.

## Ticket 1: Execution trace Layer 3b -- ghost nodes (backend required)

### What it is

Skipped steps shown in the DAG at 0.25 opacity with a `[ SKIPPED ]` badge and dashed border, so users immediately see the scale of what was bypassed without any interaction.

### Blocked on

`ConsoleDagNode` has no `stepId` field. The backend needs to either:
- Emit a step_id-to-position mapping in `executionTraceSummary`
- Or emit synthetic `skipped_step` entries as DAG nodes

Confirm whether `selected_next_step` trace refs already include skipped step IDs (check `src/v2/durable-core/domain/decision-trace-builder.ts`).

### Design reference

`docs/design/console-execution-trace-discovery.md` -- section on ghost nodes

## ~~Ticket 2: Legacy workflow modernization -- wr.adaptive-ticket-creation~~ (done)

Modernized `workflows/adaptive-ticket-creation.json` to current v2 authoring patterns:

- Added `wr.features.capabilities` declaration (workflow uses optional file system access)
- Added `pathComplexity` to `outputRequired.context` in `phase-0-triage` (structured output contract)
- Added `ticket-coverage-gate` assessment on `phase-5-batch-tickets` (bounded judgment at highest-stakes output step)
- Stamped with `validatedAgainstSpecVersion: 3`

`exploration-workflow.json` no longer exists in the bundled set. Next modernization candidate: see `docs/roadmap/open-work-inventory.md` for the current prioritized list.

## Ticket 3: Design console execution-trace explainability (Layer 3b -- ghost nodes)

### Status

Blocked on backend confirmation. `ConsoleDagNode` has no `stepId` field. The backend needs to either emit a step_id-to-position mapping or emit synthetic `skipped_step` DAG nodes before this can be built.

### What needs backend work

- Confirm whether `selected_next_step` trace refs include skipped step IDs
- Add `stepId` field to `ConsoleDagNode` DTO or a new `skipped_step` event kind
