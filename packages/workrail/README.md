## 🤔 The Problem

Large Language Models are incredibly powerful but suffer from well-documented limitations:

- **Hallucination** - They confidently generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information
- **Scope Creep** - Given a complex task, they often try to do too much at once, leading to half-baked solutions  
- **Context Loss** - They struggle to maintain focus across long conversations
- **Inconsistency** - The same prompt can yield wildly different results based on minor variations
- **Missing Prerequisites** - They often start implementing before gathering necessary context

Traditional approaches try to solve these through better prompting or more powerful models. WorkRail takes a different approach.

## 💡 The Solution

WorkRail guides LLMs through **proven software engineering best practices** via structured workflows, making it much more difficult for the LLM to go off track.

Instead of hoping an LLM will follow best practices, this system **guides them toward** best practices through structured, machine-readable workflows.

**Traditional Approach:**
```
User: "Help me implement this feature"
AI: [May or may not ask for context, may or may not plan, may or may not test]
```

**WorkRail Approach:**
```
Workflow guides: Context → Clarification → Planning → Implementation → Verification  
AI: [Cannot skip steps, must follow proven patterns]
```

This creates an enhanced experience where developers are guided through optimal workflows, missing fewer critical steps, while LLMs work within their strengths following proven patterns.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workrail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@exaudeus/workrail"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker
Add to your agent's `config.json`:
```json

      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "workrail-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🌐 External Workflows: Load from Git Repositories

**NEW in v0.6+**: Load workflows from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any Git repository!

Perfect for:
- **Team sharing** - Company-wide workflow repositories
- **Community workflows** - Shared across organizations
- **Version control** - Track workflow changes in Git
- **Multi-source** - Combine workflows from multiple repos

### Quick Start

Add to your agent config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workrail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@exaudeus/workrail"],
      "env": {
        "WORKFLOW_GIT_REPOS": "https://github.com/your-org/workflows.git",
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple Repositories

Load workflows from multiple sources (later repos override earlier ones):

```json
"env": {
  "WORKFLOW_GIT_REPOS": "https://github.com/company/workflows.git,https://gitlab.com/team/workflows.git",
  "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_xxx",
  "GITLAB_TOKEN": "glpat_xxx"
}
```

### Authentication Options

**Service-Specific Tokens** (Recommended):
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxx           # For github.com
GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat_xxxx          # For gitlab.com
BITBUCKET_TOKEN=xxx              # For bitbucket.org
```

**Self-Hosted Git** (hostname-based):
```bash
GIT_COMPANY_COM_TOKEN=xxx        # For git.company.com
GIT_INTERNAL_GITLAB_IO_TOKEN=xxx # For internal.gitlab.io
```

**SSH Keys** (no token needed):
```bash
WORKFLOW_GIT_REPOS="git@github.com:company/workflows.git"
# Uses your ~/.ssh/ keys automatically
```

**Generic Fallback**:
```bash
GIT_TOKEN=xxx                    # Used if no specific token found
WORKFLOW_GIT_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx      # Alternative generic token
```

### Repository Structure

Your Git repository should have a `/workflows` directory:

```
your-repo/
├── workflows/
│   ├── custom-workflow.json
│   ├── team-process.json
│   └── company-standard.json
└── README.md (optional)
```

### Features

- ✅ **Auto-sync** - Workflows update automatically (configurable interval)
- ✅ **Caching** - Works offline after initial clone
- ✅ **Security** - Path traversal prevention, file size limits, command injection protection
- ✅ **Priority system** - Later repos override earlier ones
- ✅ **Branch support** - Specify branch in repo config

## 💾 Using Local Workflows

WorkRail will auto-discover workflows even when added to your agent via JSON config. It searches, in priority order:

- User: `~/.workrail/workflows` (recommended)
- Project: `./workflows` relative to the MCP process `cwd`
- Custom: directories listed in `WORKFLOW_STORAGE_PATH` (colon-separated on macOS/Linux)

Example agent config passing env and `cwd` so your local workflows are picked up:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workrail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@exaudeus/workrail"],
      "env": {
        "WORKFLOW_STORAGE_PATH": "/absolute/path/my-workflows:/absolute/path/shared-workflows"
      },
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/my-project"
    }
  }
}
```

WorkRail searches for workflows in this priority order:

1. **Bundled** - Built-in workflows (always available)
2. **User** - `~/.workrail/workflows` (recommended for personal workflows)
3. **Custom** - Directories in `WORKFLOW_STORAGE_PATH` (team/shared workflows)
4. **Git Repositories** - External repos via `WORKFLOW_GIT_REPOS` ([see above](#-external-workflows-load-from-git-repositories))
5. **Project** - `./workflows` relative to process `cwd` (project-specific)

Later sources override earlier ones when workflow IDs conflict.

### Quick Tips

```bash
# Initialize your user directory
workrail init

# Validate a workflow file
workrail validate /path/to/workflow.json

# List all discovered workflows
workrail list

# Get workflow JSON schema
workrail schema
```

See `docs/workflow-management.md` for more details.

  "name": "Deep Codebase Analysis",
  "description": "Understand the codebase structure before making changes",
  "agentRole": "You are a senior engineer performing careful code analysis",
  "runCondition": {
    "type": "context",
    "key": "taskComplexity", 
    "operator": "in",
    "values": ["Medium", "Large"]
  },
  "validationCriteria": {
    "outputLength": {"min": 200, "max": 2000},
    "mustContain": ["file structure", "key components", "dependencies"]
  }
}
```

The agent receives structured guidance on **what to do**, **how to do it**, and **quality standards to meet**.

## 🌟 Why Choose WorkRail?

### Consistency & Reproducibility  
One of the biggest challenges with AI-assisted development is inconsistency. The same request can yield wildly different approaches depending on how the prompt is phrased, the LLM's randomness, or the developer's prompting expertise.

WorkRail reduces these variables:
- **Same Process** - Every developer follows the same workflow
- **Same Quality** - Helps junior developers produce work closer to senior-level quality  
- **Same Standards** - Code style and patterns are guided by workflows
- **Audit Trail** - Every decision is logged and reviewable

| Without WorkRail | With WorkRail |
|------------------|---------------|
| "Just fix this bug" → agent makes random changes | Systematic investigation → evidence-based diagnosis → targeted fix |
| "Add a feature" → incomplete implementation | Analysis → planning → implementation → testing → review |
| Inconsistent quality across tasks | Repeatable, high-quality processes |
| Outcome depends on prompting skills | Guided best practices regardless of experience |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install** WorkRail as an MCP server (see installation above)
2. **Browse workflows** - Use `workflow_list` to see available options
3. **Start a workflow** - Use `workflow_get` to load a workflow for your task  
4. **Follow the steps** - Use `workflow_next` to get guided, step-by-step instructions
5. **Validate progress** - Use `workflow_validate` to ensure quality at each step
